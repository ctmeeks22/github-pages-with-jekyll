Im starting a learning course on github.com and part of the course
is publishing a website. To do this iv had to configure stuff and
set a theme and stuff of that nature. I dont really intend to blog
if i dont have to because iv never been the kind to make my business
known to everyone and there granny. I just like learning new trades
and the more challenging the better. Anyway i hope this was enough.
Wish me luck.
